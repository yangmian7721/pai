## When to consider OpenPAI
1. When your organization needs to share powerful AI computing resources (GPU/FPGA farm, etc.) among teams.
2. When your organization needs to share and reuse common AI assets like Model, Data, Environment, etc.
3. When your organization needs an easy IT ops platform for AI.
4. When you want to run a complete training pipeline in one place. 


## Why choose OpenPAI
The platform incorporates the mature design that has a proven track record in Microsoft's large-scale production environment.

### Support on-premises and easy to deploy

OpenPAI is a full stack solution. OpenPAI not only supports on-premises, hybrid, or public Cloud deployment but also supports single-box deployment for trial users.

### Support popular AI frameworks and heterogeneous hardware

Pre-built docker for popular AI frameworks. Easy to include heterogeneous hardware. Support Distributed training, such as distributed TensorFlow.

### Most complete solution and easy to extend

OpenPAI is a most complete solution for deep learning, support virtual cluster, compatible Hadoop / kubernetes eco-system, complete training pipeline at one cluster etc. OpenPAI is architected in a modular way: different module can be plugged in as appropriate. 

## How to deploy
#### 1 Prerequisites
Before start, you need to meet the following requirements:

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Assign each server a static IP address. Network is reachable between servers.
- Server can access the external network, especially need to have access to a Docker registry service (e.g., Docker hub) to pull the Docker images for the services to be deployed.
- All machines' SSH service is enabled, share the same username / password and have sudo privilege.
- Need to enable NTP service.
- Recommend no Docker installed or a Docker with api version >= 1.26.

#### Contributors
One key purpose of PAI is to support the highly diversified requirements from academia and industry. PAI is completely open: it is under the MIT license. This makes PAI particularly attractive to evaluate various research ideas, which include but not limited to the [components](./docs/research_education.md).

PAI operates in an open model. It is initially designed and developed by [Microsoft Research (MSR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/) and [Microsoft Search Technology Center (STC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ard/company/introduction.aspx) platform team.
We are glad to have [Peking University](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/EN/), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](http://www.cesc.zju.edu.cn/index_e.htm), and [University of Science and Technology of China](http://eeis.ustc.edu.cn/) join us to develop the platform jointly.
Contributions from academia and industry are all highly welcome.
